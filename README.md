# lightgraph-go

This is an experiment in creating a GraphQL facade in front of some existing public APIs. To run it locally, set `$LS_TOKEN` to be your API key and `$LS_REST_API_URL` to be the base URL of the backing API, then run `go run ./server.go` from the commandline (or however you like to run Go code).
